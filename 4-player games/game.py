       INPUTS:    
       -------
       game_name: 
       A string containing the name of the game (e.g., 'Prisoner;s dilemma') 

       players_names: 
       A list of strings containing the name of game players

       players_strategies: 
       A dictionary whose keys are the names of players and values are a list of strings 
       containing the names of strategies played by that player. Example:
       {'player1':['strategy1','strategy2'], 'player2':['strategy1','strategy2','strategy3']}

       payoff_matrix: 
       Payoff matrix of the game. This is a dictionary with keys and values as follow: 
           Keys: 
           Tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has two elements:
           The first element is the name of the player
           The second element is the name of the strategy. 
           Note that keys cannot be a dictionary or a list because pythong
           will complain if the keys are not tuples

           Values: 
           A dictionary with keys and values as follows:
           Keys: Name of the players
           Values: Their payoff

           Example: If we have two players p1 and p2 and each can play strategies s1 or s2,
                    then the payoff_matrix is as follows: 
                    {(('p1','s1),('p2','s1')):{'p1':2,'p2':3},
                    (('p1','s1'),('p2','s2')):{'p1':0,'p':1}}

       players_strategiesDetails (optional input): 
       A diciotnary of dictionaries. The keys of the main dictionary are the names of  the game 
       palyers. The values are another dictionary. The keys of this inner dictionary are the 
       names of strategies that could be taken by that player  and the values can be any 
       data type that the user may wish (such as a list, tuple, etc). This is particularly 
       useful as sometimes a strategy invovles multiple simultaneous actions. For example, a  
       strategy by a microbial strain can be to produce three different compounds. In this case 
       the exchange rxns correspondong to those three compounds can be used as the values 
       of the inner dicitonary. Example:
       {'player1':{'strategy1':['EX_m1','EX_m2',EX_m2'],
        'strategy2':['Ex_m4']'},'player2':{'strategy1':['EX_m5'],
        'strategy2':['EX_m6','EX_m7']}'} 

       pureNashEq (optional input: 
       Pure strategy Nash equilibria of the game. This is a list of tuples whose elements are 
       the elements of the payoff matrix that are pure strategy Nash equilibria of the game. 
       For example, 
       [(('player1','strategy1'),('player2','strategy2')),(('player1','strategy3'),('player2','strategy5'))]

       Additoinal arguments, which are entered as normal but they are converted to a dictionary 
       whose keys are the names of the arguments and values are the values of those arguments
